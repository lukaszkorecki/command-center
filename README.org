   My emacs and $HOME setup. Focused on:

- Clojure
- Shell scripting in Bash
- Ops (Terraform, mostly)
- Javascript/Typescript/React


** Setup

If you want to use these yourself - probably a bad idea, given that I built all of this stuff to fit _my workflow_.

1. Fork this repo
2. Clone to  ~$HOME/.emacs.d~
3. ~cd .emacs.d && make~
3. Start Emacs, ~use-package~ will take over

*** Other tools and packages

There's a `Brewfile` provided, run `brew bundle`
